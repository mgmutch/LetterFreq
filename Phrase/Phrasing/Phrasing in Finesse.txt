seemed like,11
seemed to,11
seems like i,11
sense of,11
she must,11
should find,11
should i do,11
so actually,11
so hard,11
so i could,11
so i was thinking,11
so i would have,11
so many things,11
so maybe i,11
so that is good i,11
so we,11
some point i,11
spica dear,11
spica dear veleria,11

that so,11
the beginning,11
the bus,11
the future,11
the information,11
the rest of,11
the stimulus,11
the way i,11

think it is,11
think maybe i,11
this is a,11
this is the,11
though i do not,11
though i guess,11
time it,11
time that,11
